"""
Contains functions relevant to cross-checking odds against each other
one by one rather than querying user for an array of odds all at once.

For example, given an array of [h1, h2, h3], you query the user:
> "What are the relative odds of h1:h2?"
> "What are the relative odds of h2:h3?"
> "What are the relative odds of h3:h1?"
et cetera
